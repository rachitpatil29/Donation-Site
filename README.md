# Donation-Site


A website named Annapurna has been created. The main motive to create the project that in this pandemic of
covid-19 many people are not getting proper food and other things. And many people want to donate food 
to this people but they don't know where to donate .So our website will connect many NGO's and other
Institute to this people. There is a simple process to donate is that a person just has to fill the form that what
he/she wants to donate .This all information will be deliverd to all the NGO's and then the nearest NGO or
Institute will come to the doorstep and collect the food .People can also donate money to any NGO's/Institute
. The donated thing will be displayed on the wall of the website with the name of donor and what he/she has
donated
